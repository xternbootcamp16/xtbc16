## Topics

Today we implemented updating and deleting notes from the Meganote API. We used `$http` in our own service and bound objects from our controller to a view.

## Projects

Meganote, now with updating and deleting: [source](https://github.com/xternbootcamp16/meganote/tree/3422d653cacfb02be956b99610bb4af87be6bfa8) | [live](http://bootcamp16.getfretless.com/meganote/#/notes/)

## Homework

* Display a success message when an API operation succeeds.
* Display an error message when an API operation fails.
