## Topics

### MEAN
We've been developing with the so-called _MEAN_ stack. MEAN is an acronym.

* [**M**ongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) - database
* [**E**xpress](http://expressjs.com/) - minimalist web framework for Node
* [**A**ngular](https://angularjs.org/) - front-end MVW framework
* [**N**ode](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime for executing JS outside a browser environment, such as on a server

### Filters and Focus
* Using [`filter`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/filter) to get a subset of an array (_e.g._ to search through a list of notes, showing only the matches).
* Overcoming HTML5's inability to deal with autofocus in dynamic templates with a custom directive.
