We'll be using the command line a fair amount in class. I recommend installing a UNIX-style shell in Windows, as it will allow to use the same commands that I use.

## Babun

[Babun](http://babun.github.io/) is a UNIX shell for Windows that includes some tools we might otherwise need to install separately. Like most UNIX shells for Windows, Babun is based on Cygwin, but it's preconfigured to be a lot more usable out of the box.

By default, Babun launches a shell called ZSH. It also includes [Oh My ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/), a framework for configuring ZSH.

We'll use the shell often enough that I recommend pinning Babun to the taskbar.
