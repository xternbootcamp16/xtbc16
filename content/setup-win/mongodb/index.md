We'll use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on at least one project, so follow the [installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) to get MongoDB running.

For Windows 7 and newer, you want the version that describes itself as being for **Windows Server 2008 R2 and later**.
