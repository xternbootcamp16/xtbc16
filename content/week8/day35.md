## Topics

### Markdown
We've covered markdown briefly before.  [Here is a link](/week3/day14) to the page that has several great resources for learning and using markdown.  Specifically, we used markdown to write a `README.md` for our Meganote project on Github.  

#### Important info to include in a `README.md`

* Description of the project
* Technologies used in the project
* Dependencies
* Instructions for getting the project up and running
* Configuration options
* Deployment Instructions

[Here is a link](https://github.com/xternbootcamp16/meganote/blob/master/README.md) to the `README.md` that we wrote today for Meganote as an example.

{{% notice tip %}}
The Atom text editor has a package available called `markdown-preview`.  It allows you to see a live preview of how your markdown file will look when it is rendered.
