## Topics

### Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with extremely readable syntax. It was specifically built with programmer happiness and productivity in mind.

#### Some Ruby links
  * [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - the official website for Ruby
  * [Codecademy - Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) - a great way to get started with the basics of Ruby syntax
  * [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/) - an entertaining, if eccentric, intro to Ruby

### Ruby on Rails
Rails is an open source web framework built with Ruby.  Like Ruby, it was built with an emphasis on productivity and programmer happiness by following principles of _convention over configuration_.  This means that many of the tiny decisions that have to be made in nearly every web app - ('should we name that variable "id", "postId", "post_id"...?') - are largely unnecessary and don't need to be solved repeatedly.  By following conventions for these types of decisions, more effort can be put towards the parts of the program that matter and productivity can be greatly increase.

  * [railstutorial.org](https://www.railstutorial.org/) - Michael Hartl's free and excellent tutorial of building a social-networking app from the ground up
